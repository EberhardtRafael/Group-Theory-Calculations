# Group-Theory-Calculations

A bunch of code refering to Group Theory calculations developed throughout my master's program in Theoretical Physics.
Most of the important codes I still have to publish here, but not now, cause I still haven't published my paper.

What I have here already is part of a library built on C extended to Python for drawing Ypung Diagrams as well as calculating tensor products between irreps of the SU(N).
